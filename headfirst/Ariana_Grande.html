        <h1>Ariana Grande</h1>
        <img src="star_image/ariana/ariana2.jpg" width="534" height="300" alt="ariana">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Ariana Grande-Butera is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. 
            Her four-octave vocal range has received critical acclaim, and her personal life has been the subject of widespread media attention.
             She has received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two Grammy Awards, one Brit Award, one Bambi Award, 
             two Billboard Music Awards, three American Music Awards, nine MTV Video Music Awards, and 27 Guinness World Records. </p>
        <h2>Celebrity Tale</h2>
        <p>Her music and acting career began as early as 2008 when she starred on a Broadway musical <q>13</q>.<br>
           Between 2010 and 2013, she rose to fame playing <em>Cat Valentine</em> in the <em>Nickelodeon TV series</em> <q>Victorious</q>.</p>

        <img src="star_image/ariana/cat_valentine3.jpg" width="225" height="300">
        <p>In this period, her portrayal of <em>Cat Valentine</em> as an innocent, silly and sweet girl gave the audience an impression that she has similar character. 
            She later revealed on social media that dying her hair maroon once a week every week while shooting <q>Victorious</q> did severe damage to her hair, 
            and her later iconic ponytail hairstyle was actually an attempt to hide hairloss from her <em>Nickelodeon</em> period.</p>

        <p>Grande signed with <em>Republic Records</em> in 2011 after label executives viewed YouTube videos of her covering songs, 
            the most famous of which was <em>Mariah Carey's</em> <q>Emotions</q>, consisting of dolphin-sounding vocals.</p>

        <p tooltip="hello">Her first three albums, <em>Yours Truly, My Everything</em> and <em>Dangerous Woman,</em> released in that order, 
            all topped the <em>US billboard 200</em>. 
            She explored the genres of <em>pop</em> and <em>R&B</em> in these early albums, which were well-received by music critics.
            Leading singles such as <em>The Way, Problem and Dangerous Woman</em> were proof of her musical talent, capability and potential. </p>

        <img src="star_image/ariana/ariana_dangerous_woman.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="dangerous woman">
        <p>Personal struggles influenced her trap-infused fourth and fifth studio albums, <em>Sweetener</em> and <em>Thank U, Next</em>,
             both of which were critical and commercial successes. <em>Sweetener</em> won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, 
             and <em>Thank U, Next</em> broke the record for the largest streaming week for a pop album 
             and was nominated for Album of the Year.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, the cover of both albums features Ariana upside-down, probably to indicate complicated personal affairs.
            Singles in <em>Thank U, next</em> such as <em>Thank U, next</em> and <em>7 rings</em> were particularly successful,
            not only holding the top spots on the <em>Billboard Hot 100</em> simultaneously, but also making Ariana the first female artist at the top of the UK Singles Chart.

        <img src="star_image/ariana/_7_rings.png" width="300" height="300" alt="7 rings">
        <p>Ariana expresses grattitude to her ex-boyfriends for what she learned in relationships in her single <em>Thank U, Next</em>.
         Her firm belief in her own value instead of seeking a sense of belonging in relationships is aspiring to fans. On the other hand,
         in <em>7 Rings</em>, Ariana puts stress on the power of friendship and the convenience of affluence.</p>
         <h3>Tribute to Classics</h3>
         <p>The MV of <em>Thank U, Next</em> pays tribute to various classic movies, including <em>Mean Girls</em> while 
         the tune of <em>7 Rings</em> is derived from <em>My Favourite Things</em> in the musical <em>the Sound of Music</em>.</p>
